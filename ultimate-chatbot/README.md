# Ultimate 7-Layer Chatbot Blueprint

## Feasibility Summary
Building a "7-layer" chatbot stack that keeps each layer isolated yet
interconnected is feasible with the assets already present in this repository
and Cloudflare's edge platform. The existing applications in `apps/` supply the
core capabilities for conversation UIs, agent brains, inference runtimes,
security enforcement, and forensic analysis. Cloudflare Workers, Durable
Objects, Queues, R2, Zero Trust, and KV/Vectorize can be used to harden
communication between layers while maintaining low-latency routing and
observability.

The recommended approach is to stage the integration scaffolding inside this
repository (for code review and IaC management) while deploying the production
workloads to Cloudflare's infrastructure. Each layer becomes its own Worker
service (or collection of services) with explicit API contracts and Zero Trust
policies. This separation satisfies cyber security requirements, simplifies
incident response, and keeps sensitive inference or scanning logic in
compartmentalized environments.

## Layered Architecture Mapping
| Layer | Purpose | Recommended Component(s) | Cloudflare Role |
|-------|---------|---------------------------|-----------------|
| 1. User Interface | Multilingual chat front ends with PDF/BM25 search. | `index.html`, `apps/LibreChat`, `apps/agents-starter` | Static assets on Pages; Worker proxy injects auth tokens, rate limits. |
| 2. Firewall & Policy | Prompt/code moderation, anomaly detection, request brokering. | `apps/PurpleLlama`, Zero Trust Gateway | Dedicated Worker with Llama Guard + Prompt Guard; integrates with Cloudflare Zero Trust policies. |
| 3. CISA Thorium Analysis | Deep file/repo inspection and SOC automation. | `apps/thorium-eter` | Isolated Worker with Durable Object orchestrating remote scanners (Cloudflare Tunnel to private cluster). |
| 4. Tiny ML Services | Edge-friendly classical ML scoring (intent, BM25, embeddings). | `apps/TinyLLM` BM25/embedding scripts, custom Workers using WASM models | Worker with WASM models, Workers AI bindings, or KV for indexes. |
| 5. Tiny LLM Inference | Lightweight conversational models for rapid responses. | `apps/TinyLlama`, `apps/TinyLLM` | Worker calling Workers AI or self-hosted TinyLLM via secure HTTPS (mTLS). |
| 6. Tiny AI Orchestration | Tool routing, RAG, automation logic. | `apps/LangBot`, `apps/agents-starter` | Durable Object maintaining sessions, orchestrating tool calls, caching context in KV/D1. |
| 7. Enterprise LLM/ML Backbone | High-throughput models, external MCPs, analytics. | `apps/vllm`, `apps/ollama`, `apps/github-mcp-server` | Worker acting as broker to external MCP servers via Zero Trust tunnels; audit logs to R2/Logs. |

Each `layers/layerX-*` directory stores integration code, configuration, docs,
and IaC excerpts specific to that layer. Deployment-ready Workers live under
`infrastructure/cloudflare/workers/` to keep runtime code distinct from design
artifacts or local tooling. Boilerplate Workers, policies, and pipeline
templates are now committed so you can clone, configure secrets, and deploy each
layer independently.

## Scaffolded Implementation Assets

- **Cloudflare Workers** – Seven TypeScript entrypoints under
  `infrastructure/cloudflare/workers/` demonstrate session handling, firewall
  checks, BM25 scoring, TinyLLM proxying, orchestration fan-out, and audit
  logging patterns.
- **Wrangler Configuration** – `infrastructure/cloudflare/wrangler.toml` defines
  per-layer environments, routes, and shared bindings that you can customize for
  your tenant.
- **Security Policies** – `infrastructure/policies/zero-trust.yml` and
  `compliance.md` align identity, posture, and logging controls with NIST CSF,
  PCI DSS 4.0, and CISA Cyber Essentials.
- **Deployment Pipelines** – `infrastructure/cloudflare/pipelines/README.md`
  includes a reusable GitHub Actions skeleton for CI/CD with Wrangler.
- **Operational Runbooks** – Each `layers/layerX-*/README.md` outlines
  responsibilities, setup checklists, and handoffs for cross-team coordination.

## Security & Compliance Considerations
1. **Zero Trust Per Layer** – Require device posture checks, mTLS, and signed JWTs
   per layer before forwarding traffic. Workers KV/Secrets store ephemeral keys;
   Durable Objects manage rotating credentials.
2. **Data Minimization** – Store only hashed or encrypted session data (AES-256)
   in D1/R2. Apply field-level encryption for PCI/GDPR compliance.
3. **Observability** – Ship logs to Cloudflare Logs + R2; mirror to SIEM (e.g.,
   Wazuh, Splunk) for continuous monitoring. Map events to NIST CSF functions.
4. **Change Management** – Manage IaC via Git workflows. Use GitHub Actions with
   OIDC to authenticate to Cloudflare and enforce policy-as-code checks.
5. **Incident Response** – Document runbooks per layer. Thorium layer can stage
   forensic captures while firewall layer triggers automated isolation.

## Implementation Roadmap
1. **Scaffold Layer Directories** – Use this repository to host baseline Worker
   skeletons, Terraform (if desired), and documentation. Start with Layer 1 UI
   and Layer 2 firewall to validate routing.
2. **Configure Cloudflare Environments** – Create separate Worker namespaces per
   layer, set up KV/Durable Objects, enable Zero Trust policies, configure
   service bindings for controlled inter-layer calls.
3. **Integrate Existing Apps** – Fork relevant modules from `apps/` into the
   appropriate layer directories (e.g., adapt PurpleLlama guard scripts for the
   firewall Worker). Provide scripts to package and deploy to Cloudflare.
4. **Secure Communications** – Implement signed request envelopes (HMAC or mTLS)
   between Workers. Use Cloudflare Queues for asynchronous tasks (e.g., Thorium
   scans) to avoid synchronous coupling.
5. **Testing & Compliance Validation** – Build CI workflows to run unit tests,
   security scans, linting, and compliance checklists (PCI DSS 3–11) prior to
   deployment. Utilize Cloudflare's preview environments for staged rollout.

## Cloudflare Deployment Tips
- **Wrangler Configuration** – Use a root `wrangler.toml` with per-layer
  `[env.layerX]` sections, enabling shared bindings (KV, D1) but unique routes.
- **Internal APIs** – When layers must communicate, prefer `service bindings`
  instead of raw HTTP calls to stay within Cloudflare's secure mesh.
- **Edge Storage** – KV for configs, Durable Objects for session state, R2 for
  artifacts (PDFs), D1 for audit logs, Vectorize for embeddings supporting BM25
  or hybrid search in Layer 1/4.
- **Workers AI** – Bind to Workers AI for inference where latency is critical;
  fallback to TinyLLM/TinyLlama endpoints behind Zero Trust tunnels for private
  inference.

## Next Steps
1. Approve the directory structure and blueprint.
2. Generate Worker templates for each layer (TypeScript/JavaScript or Rust).
3. Define API contracts (OpenAPI specs) to document payloads and policies.
4. Create automation scripts (e.g., `npm create cloudflare@latest`) to produce
   downloadable bundles for each layer.
5. Establish GitHub Actions pipeline to lint, test, and deploy per layer.

Once these steps are in place, we can iteratively flesh out each layer with the
required code, configuration, and documentation while maintaining rigorous
separation for cyber security and compliance.
