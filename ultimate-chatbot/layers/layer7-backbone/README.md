# Layer 7 â€“ Enterprise Backbone

Acts as the control plane for enterprise LLMs/ML services, MCP integrations,
and audit storage.

## Responsibilities
- Validate signed audit/event payloads from Layer 6 and other services.
- Persist tamper-evident records to R2 or external SIEM targets.
- Expose health/status endpoints for observability and incident response.
- Broker outbound connections to MCP servers, vLLM clusters, or analytics
  systems via Zero Trust tunnels.

## Setup Checklist
1. Deploy the Worker located at `infrastructure/cloudflare/workers/layer7-backbone`.
2. Bind `HMAC_SECRET` and optional `AUDIT_BUCKET` (R2) along with service
   bindings to MCP or analytics Workers.
3. Configure log streaming to your SIEM using Cloudflare Logpush.
4. Document `/audit` and `/health` in `openapi.yaml`.

## Handoffs
- Supplies forensic and compliance data to SOC tooling.
- Feeds analytic dashboards that monitor AI, ML, and security posture.
