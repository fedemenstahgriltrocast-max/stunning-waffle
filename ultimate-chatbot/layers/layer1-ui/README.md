# Layer 1 â€“ User Interface

This layer hosts customer-facing chat clients (web, mobile, kiosk) that interact with the orchestrator through the Layer 1 Cloudflare Worker.

## Responsibilities
- Serve static chat UIs (Pages or Workers Sites).
- Handle PDF uploads and BM25/hybrid search prompts.
- Enforce CORS, rate limiting, and human verification before forwarding traffic to Layer 2.

## Setup Checklist
1. Deploy the Worker at `infrastructure/cloudflare/workers/layer1-ui` via Wrangler.
2. Configure Pages or a static hosting bucket to serve your UI assets.
3. Bind `SESSION_KV` for session storage and `FIREWALL_SERVICE` for Zero Trust validation.
4. Document UI routes in `openapi.yaml` (create in this directory).

## Handoffs
- Requests that pass verification call the Layer 6 orchestrator.
- File uploads are sent to Layer 7 for compliance storage via signed URLs.
