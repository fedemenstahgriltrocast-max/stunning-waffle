# Layer 7 â€“ Enterprise Backbone

Acts as the control plane for enterprise LLMs/ML services, MCP integrations,
and audit storage.

## Responsibilities
- Validate signed audit/event payloads from Layer 6 and other services.
- Partition logs, storage buckets, and outbound credentials per tenant so data
  residency and contractual boundaries are preserved when many websites share
  the mesh.
- Persist tamper-evident records to object storage or external SIEM targets.
- Expose health/status endpoints for observability and incident response.
- Broker outbound connections to MCP servers, large-model clusters, or
  analytics systems via Zero Trust tunnels.

## Setup Checklist
1. Deploy the Worker located at `edge-mesh/workers/layer7-backbone`.
2. Bind `HMAC_SECRET` and optional `AUDIT_BUCKET` (object storage) along with
   service bindings to MCP or analytics Workers. Consider per-tenant buckets or
   prefixes plus a metadata table that maps tenant IDs to storage locations.
3. Configure log streaming to your SIEM using your perimeter's log push
   service, annotating events with tenant identifiers for filtered access.
4. Document `/audit` and `/health` in `openapi.yaml`.

## Handoffs
- Supplies forensic and compliance data to SOC tooling.
- Feeds analytic dashboards that monitor AI, ML, and security posture.
