# Chatbot Protection & Integration Checklist

## Security & Compliance APIs
- **Identity & Access Management:** Integrate OAuth 2.0 / OIDC providers (e.g., Auth0, Okta, Azure AD) for SSO, MFA, and least-privilege session policies.
- **Secrets Management:** Connect to HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager for encrypted storage of API keys, signing certificates, and environment variables.
- **Key Management Service (KMS):** Use cloud-native KMS (AWS KMS, GCP KMS, Azure Key Vault) to manage AES-256 encryption keys for data at rest.
- **Certificate Lifecycle:** Automate TLS/SSL provisioning and renewal via ACME-compatible services (Let’s Encrypt, Cloudflare SSL) to enforce HTTPS/HSTS.
- **Threat Intelligence & Reputation APIs:** Leverage services such as Google Safe Browsing, VirusTotal, and Recorded Future for URL/file threat checks before chatbot execution.

## Application Protection Layers
- **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Enable Cloudflare, AWS WAF, or Azure Front Door rulesets tuned for bot mitigation, rate limiting, and OWASP Top 10 coverage.
- **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Apply strict CSP headers, X-Frame-Options, Referrer-Policy, and CORS rules through edge/CDN configuration.
- **Abuse & Anomaly Detection:** Stream chatbot telemetry to SIEM/SOAR platforms (Splunk, Datadog, Microsoft Sentinel) with baselined anomaly alerting.
- **Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP):** Embed RASP agents (Contrast Security, Imperva) for in-app exploit detection and automatic blocking.
- **Input Validation & Sanitization:** Implement NLP-aware sanitization libraries (Microsoft Presidio, spaCy clean pipelines) and large language model guardrails.

## Data Governance & Privacy
- **Data Loss Prevention (DLP):** Integrate Google Cloud DLP or Nightfall AI to classify and mask sensitive data in prompts, logs, and transcripts.
- **Consent & Preference Management:** Sync with privacy APIs (OneTrust, TrustArc) to honor GDPR/CCPA user rights and consent states.
- **Audit & Logging Pipelines:** Route structured logs to immutable storage (AWS CloudTrail Lake, Azure Log Analytics) with PCI DSS Req.10 retention policies.
- **Tokenization & Pseudonymization:** Use PCI-compliant token vaults for payment data and PII before exposing to chatbot workflows.

## Reliability & Observability
- **Service Health Monitoring:** Tie into observability stacks (Prometheus/Grafana, Datadog, New Relic) for uptime, latency, and Core Web Vitals metrics.
- **Incident Response Automation:** Connect PagerDuty, Opsgenie, or xMatters for runbook-driven escalation aligned to NIST CSF Respond/Recover phases.
- **Backup & Continuity:** Schedule encrypted backups via cloud-native snapshot APIs and validate MTTR/MTTD targets.

## AI/LLM Safeguards
- **Model Access Controls:** Gate model endpoints behind API gateways with JWT or mTLS authentication and fine-grained throttling.
- **Safety & Moderation APIs:** Integrate OpenAI, Google Perspective, or Azure Content Safety for toxicity, self-harm, and compliance filtering.
- **Prompt Injection Defense:** Leverage guardrail frameworks (NVIDIA NeMo Guardrails, LangChain guard modules) and maintain allow/deny knowledge bases.
- **Model Monitoring:** Capture prompts/completions in monitoring services (Arize AI, WhyLabs) for drift detection, bias auditing, and PCI DSS audit trails.
- **Federated/Tiny LLM Options:** When processing sensitive data, consider on-device Tiny LLM deployments with encrypted edge models for privacy-preserving inference.

## Deployment & Governance Integrations
- **CI/CD Security:** Enforce signed commits, dependency scanning (GitHub Advanced Security, OWASP Dependency-Check), and IaC policies (OPA, Sentinel).
- **Infrastructure as Code:** Manage chatbot infrastructure with Terraform/Ansible plus policy-as-code guardrails for repeatable, audited deployments.
- **Change Management:** Hook into ITSM platforms (ServiceNow, Jira Service Management) for approval workflows and post-change reviews.
- **Documentation Portals:** Maintain living runbooks and architecture diagrams in Confluence/Notion with version control and reviewer sign-off.

## Reference Frameworks & Standards
- **OPS CyberSec Core:** Map Identify→Protect→Detect→Respond→Recover controls to chatbot lifecycle.
- **NIST CSF + CISA Cyber Essentials:** Use as baseline for risk assessment, incident response, and continuous improvement.
- **PCI DSS 4.0 Requirements 3–11:** Apply to payment or PII handling components, ensuring encryption, logging, and testing controls.
- **WCAG 2.1 AA & ADA Compliance:** Ensure accessible conversational UI flows with keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility.
- **GDPR/CCPA:** Document data processing, retention limits, and DSAR/RTBF handling within chatbot workflows.
