# Commenting on Files

Commenting on files is a great way to share your progress and insights from analyzing a file. Anyone that
is a member of at least one of your groups that has access to the file will be able to view your comment. You can
leave a comment on a file through the Web UI by following the steps shown in the video below.

  <source src="../static_resources/files/file-comment.mp4", type="video/mp4">

## Comment Attachments

You can also upload files as attachments to your comments. Unlike files/samples, comment attachments are not stored in the
safe CaRTed format. Only submit benign data as a comment attachment.

If you need to submit a manually modified version of
a sample, you can do so by uploading the modified sample with an Origin of `Unpacked` or `Transformed` and with the
`Parent` value set to the `SHA256` of the original file.
