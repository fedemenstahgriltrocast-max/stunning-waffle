# Users

The Thorium user role is the default role for any newly created Thorium account. Thorium users can range from incident
responders to malware reverse engineers or vulnerability researchers. With this role you can:

  - upload files and Git repositories
  - add and remove metadata tags on uploaded files and repositories
  - run a pipeline on a file or repository (called a reaction)
  - view reaction status and logs
  - view tool results
  - comment on files and upload comment attachments
  - create new groups

Permissions that users do not have:

  - create or modify tools (images) or pipelines

  If you need to create or modify analysis pipelines, you may need to ask the admins of your Thorium instance to add you as a
  [Developer](../developers/developers.md).
