This guide will cover how to start using Thorium to analyze data at scale.

Most tasks in Thorium can be accomplished in both the Web UI and our command line tool called Thorctl (pronounced
Thor-cuddle). The interface you choose to use will depend on the number of samples or repositories you are working with
and whether a browser client is accessible within your own analysis environment. If you need to analyze hundreds or
thousands of samples, you can utilize Thorctl to upload the data, run analysis jobs, and download then results of those
jobs. Thorctl is also useful when working on a "headless" analysis environment where only a command line interface is
at your disposal. Alternatively, the Web UI provides an easy way to upload, analyze, and view a smaller number of
samples and repos for those with access to a browser client. The Web UI also provides the ability create groups and
modify group membership.

If you have already registered for a Thorium account you can skip to the [Login](./login.md) section of this chapter.
