# Concepts

When using Thorium there are some concepts that you will need to understand:
- Users
- Groups
- Files
- Pipelines
- Images
- Reactions
- Streams

In this section we will cover what these concepts are and how you create and
interact with them. In a later section we will walk through creating and using
a pipeline within Thorium so focus on understanding the concepts and their
functionality during this chapter.
