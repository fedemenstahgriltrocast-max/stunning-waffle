# Ban Things in Thorium

> This is documentation for Thorium admins looking to create bans.
> For general information on bans and ban types in Thorium, see [Bans](../developers/bans.md).

Although bans are often manually generated by the Thorium API and Scaler, Thorium admins can also
manually ban entities to prevent users from using them.

## Adding a Ban

You can create a ban with Thorctl by using the entity's respective subcommand and invoking their
`bans create` function.

```Bash
thorctl <images/pipelines> bans create <group> <image/pipeline> --msg <MESSAGE>
```

This will create a `Generic`-type ban containing the given message. This also generates an `Error`
level notification associated with the entity that users can view to see the reason for the ban.
The notification is tied to the ban and will be automatically deleted when the ban is removed.

## Removing a Ban

Because `Generic`-type bans are created manually, they must be removed manually as well. You'll
need the ban's ID if you want to remove a ban. You can view an entity's bans and their id's along
with other metadata by using the Thorctl `describe` command:

```Bash
thorctl <ENTITY-TYPE> describe <ENTITY-NAME>
```

This will output the entity's data in JSON format, including its bans:

```JSON
{
    ...
    "bans": {
        "bfe49500-dfcb-4790-a6b3-379114222426": {
            "id": "bfe49500-dfcb-4790-a6b3-379114222426",
            "time_banned": "2024-10-31T22:31:59.251188Z",
            "ban_kind": {
                "Generic": {
                    "msg": "This is an example ban"
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Take note of the ban's ID and provide it to the `bans delete` command to remove it:

```Bash
thorctl <ENTITY-TYPE> bans delete <BAN-ID>
```

> Note that removing automatically generated bans is not generally advised, as Thorium will
> eventually re-ban the entity automatically unless the underlying issue is resolved.
