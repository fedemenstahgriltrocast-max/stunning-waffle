Thorium is a highly scalable, distributed malware analysis and data generation framework. Thorium is designed to make
cyber incident response, triage, and file analysis easier through the safe ingestion and storage of data, automation of
analyses and easy access to stored analyses and metadata. Because of the sensitivity and potential maliciousness of
data handled within Thorium, uploaded files are placed into an encrypted/neutered format called
[CaRT](./help/faq.html#what-is-cart-and-how-can-i-uncart-malware-samples-that-i-download-from-thorium). After initial
file upload, all analysis is conducted in sandboxed environments where protective measures and sanitization steps can
be easily applied.
