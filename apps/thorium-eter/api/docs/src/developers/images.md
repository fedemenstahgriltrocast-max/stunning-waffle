# What Are Images?
---

In Thorium a tool is called an image. Images are a combination of a command line (CLI) tool and all the configuration
information needed to run that tool in one of Thorium's execution environments. Before you can add or modify an image,
you must have the developer role. If you don't yet have that role, you may request it from your local Thorium admins.
Once you have the developer role, you can learn about the process for [adding new images](./add_images.md) and how to
correctly [configure images](./configuring_images.md).
